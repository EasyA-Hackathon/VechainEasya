Unlock the potential of decentralized application development on Vechain with our X-App template for VeBetterDAO. Designed for the Vechain Thor blockchain, this template integrates cutting-edge technologies such as React, TypeScript, Hardhat, and Express, ensuring a seamless and efficient DApp development experience. üåü

Read more about the implementation and key features of this template in our [Developer Docs](https://docs.vebetterdao.org/developer-guides/integration-examples/pattern-2-use-smart-contracts-and-backend).

This template uses the VeBetterDAO ecosystem to distribute rewards to users. To learn more about VeBetterDAO, visit our [documentation](https://docs.vebetterdao.org/developer-guides/integration-examples).

When using the solo node you can import the following mnemonic into your wallet and have access to 10 pre-funded accounts:

```
denial kitchen pet squirrel other broom bar gas better priority spoil cross
```

## Requirements

Ensure your development environment is set up with the following:

- **Node.js (v18 or later):** [Download here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) üì•
- **Yarn:** [Install here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) üß∂
- **Docker (for containerization):** [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) üê≥
- **Hardhat (for smart contracts):** [Getting Started with Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started) ‚õëÔ∏è

## Project Structure

### Frontend (apps/frontend) üåê

A blazing-fast React application powered by Vite:

- **Vechain dapp-kit:** Streamline wallet connections and interactions. [Learn more](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/dapp-kit)

### Backend (apps/backend) üîô

An Express server crafted with TypeScript for robust API development:

- **Vechain SDK:** Seamlessly fetch and perform transactions with the VechainThor blockchain. [Learn more](https://docs.vechain.org/developer-resources/sdks-and-providers/sdk)
- **OpenAI GPT-Vision-Preview:** Integrate image analysis capabilities. [Explore here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision)

### Contracts (apps/contracts) üìú

Smart contracts in Solidity, managed with Hardhat for deployment on the Vechain Thor network.

### Packages üì¶

Shared configurations and utility functions to unify and simplify your development process.

## Environment Variables ‚öôÔ∏è

Configure your environment variables for seamless integration:

### Frontend

Place your `.env` files in `apps/frontend`:

- **VITE_RECAPTCHA_V3_SITE_KEY:** [Request your RecaptchaV3 site keys](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3)

### Backend

Store your environment-specific `.env` files in `apps/backend`. `.env.development.local` & `.env.production.local` allow for custom environment variables based on the environment:

- **OPENAI_API_KEY:** [Get your GPT-4 OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (Enable GPT-4 [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7102672-how-can-i-access-gpt-4-gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4o))
- **RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY:** [Request your RecaptchaV3 site keys](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3)

### Contracts

Manage deployment parameters and network configurations in `hardhat.config.js` under `apps/contracts`:

- **MNEMONIC:** Mnemonic of the deploying wallet

## Getting Started üèÅ

Clone the repository and install dependencies with ease:

```bash
yarn install # Run this at the root level of the project
```

To distribute rewards this contract necesitates of a valid APP_ID provided by VeBetterDAO when joining the ecosystem.
In testnet you can generate the APP_ID by using the [VeBetterDAO sandbox](https://dev.testnet.governance.vebetterdao.org/).
This contract can be initially deployed without this information and DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can update it later through {EcoEarn-setAppId}.

This contract must me set as a `rewardDistributor` inside the X2EarnApps contract to be able to send rewards to users and withdraw.

## Deploying Contracts üöÄ

Deploy your contracts effortlessly on either the Testnet or Solo networks.
If you are deploying on the Testnet, ensure you have the correct addresses in the `config-contracts` package (generated on the [VeBetterDAO sandbox](https://dev.testnet.governance.vebetterdao.org/)).
When deploying on the SOLO network the script will deploy for you the mocked VeBetterDAO contracts and generate an APP_ID.

### Deploying on Solo Network

```bash
yarn contracts:deploy:solo
```

### Deploying on Testnet

```bash
yarn contracts:deploy:testnet
```

## Running on Solo Network üîß

Run the Frontend and Backend, connected to the Solo network and pointing to your deployed contracts. Ensure all environment variables are properly configured:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Setting up rewards

## Testnet

Read the [VeBetterDAO documentation](https://docs.vebetterdao.org/developer-guides/test-environmnet) to learn how to set up rewards for your users and use the Testnet environment.

Test environment: [https://dev.testnet.governance.vebetterdao.org/](https://dev.testnet.governance.vebetterdao.org/)

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 57.971%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/175r1s?quality=highest" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

## Solo Network

Since the Solo network is a local network with mocked VeBetterDAO contracts you can use the following steps to set up available rewards to distribute to users:

0. Ensure you are using a wallet with imported pre-funded accounts mnemonic into your wallet. Mnemoninc:

```
denial kitchen pet squirrel other broom bar gas better priority spoil cross
```

1. Copy the `APP_ID` generated by the `contracts:deploy:solo` script and logged in the console.
2. Run `devpal`, a frontend tool to interact with your contracts:

```bash
npx @vechain/devpal http://localhost:8669
```

3. Open the `Inspector` tab and perform the following actions:
4. Add the B3TR_Mock contract (get the address from the console logs and ABI from the `apps/contracts/artifacts/contracts/mock/B3TR_Mock.sol/B3TR_Mock.json` file)
   ![image](https://i.ibb.co/6Zrj7Nx/SCR-20240723-jorq.png)
5. Add the X2EarnRewardsPool contract (get the address from the console logs and ABI from the `apps/contracts/artifacts/contracts/mock/X2EarnRewardsPoolMock.sol/X2EarnRewardsPoolMock.json` file)
   ![image](https://i.ibb.co/yYjLw9v/SCR-20240723-jozk.png)
6. You should now have the following setup:
   ![image](https://i.ibb.co/w4XWyh9/SCR-20240723-jpbc.png)
7. To recharge the rewards pool you will need to mint some mocked B3TR tokens, then deposit them into the rewards pool. Perform the following actions:
   - Mint some tokens by calling the `mint` function on the B3TR_Mock contract
     ![image](https://i.ibb.co/XCQ7LNR/SCR-20240723-kgll.png)
   - Approve the X2EarnRewards contract to spend the tokens by calling the `approve` function on the B3TR_Mock contract
     ![image](hhttps://i.ibb.co/7WvQL15/SCR-20240723-kedb.png)
   - Deposit the tokens into the rewards pool by calling the `deposit` function on the X2EarnRewardsPool contract

NB: Values are in wei, use this tool to convert to VET: [https://eth-converter.com/](https://eth-converter.com/)

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This template serves as a foundational starting point and should be thoroughly reviewed and customized to suit your project‚Äôs specific requirements. Pay special attention to configurations, security settings, and environment variables to ensure a secure and efficient deployment.
